### This is a compilation of helpful resources and insights on learning programming and Computer Science in general

You can call it an accelerated learning process. Whether you have just started your degree/diploma in computing-related courses, taking coding bootcamp or learning computer science by yourself, this is a knowledge repository that some of us have put together to enhance your learning.

This guide is recommended for people with self-starting capability and the tenacity to truly learn something because there will be a lot of readings involved (try watching this [TED talk by Angela Duckworth about grit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8)). The only thing that we have done here is to make it easier for you to start since most of the materials have been compiled for you to dive deep into. Think of it as a diving platform normally found in swimming pools. You can always jump and dive to the pool, but with the platform you can jump higher and reach deeper water levels.

The information provided here might/might not have been taught in your university, as it includes a vast amount of external sources from various fields. What's important is this: if you successully read through everything that we have here, you'll look back and realize how little you would have known back then.

### Contents

To accomodate the widest categories of people, we splitted the core information that we're providing to few "tracks". Each of these tracks could be followed on its own while it has also been designed in a way that you can follow it subsequently in order it's arranged. This is done to serve the best interest of people to reach their destinations in the most efficient way.
