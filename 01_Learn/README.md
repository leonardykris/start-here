### "The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future. You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else." - [Gabe Newell](https://code.org/quotes) ([Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/))

> "I was expecting the knowledge to be brought to me and the techniques to be handed to me on a silver platter as the case is in school. I was mistaken. Learning to code is about learning to search for the correct info, methods, techniques thanks only to our friend, Google. Coding is about learning how to learn." <br>([3 Reasons Why You Should Absolutely Learn to Code](https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/3-reasons-why-you-should-absolutely-learn-to-code-8c524dac8120#.nkzoow9dr))

### Typing speed

It might be great to improve your typing speed too. If you haven't been typing with all 10 of your fingers, you should training for it because it will improves your typing speed immensely. After you're comfortable with it, try benchmarking your speed at [10 Fast Fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english). [@leonardykris](https://github.com/leonardykris) has an average of 85-90 words per minute.

## Communities

It's always great to learn together with other people. Think of it as your support group/network where everybody is encouraging each other to do more, and to be better every day.
